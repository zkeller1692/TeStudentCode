# Module 1 Checkpoint Exercise

The checkpoint helps you validate your understanding of the Module 1 objectives:
* Variables and data types 
* Conditional and iteration logic 
* Object-Oriented Programming 
* File I/O and Collections
* Unit Testing 

It also gives you practice with coding challenges you may encounter during the job interview process.

## Overview

This is a time-boxed, individual coding assignment. You have one hour to complete the assignment. You are not expected to complete all the features of the problem in the time given. Complete as much as you can.

You may use any resource available as long as the effort remains an individual effort.

Whatever you submit should not have compile or run-time errors. Features that are completed should run successfully. Any unit tests you write should be error-free and run successfully.

If you are nearing the end of the assignment and you have compile/run-time errors, consider commenting out or removing the code that causes the errors.

At the end of the assignment, you should push your final code to your repository.

If you finish before the end of the hour, you're free to leave the Zoom meeting after pushing your code.

## Instructions

1. Pull from your repository like you do every day. The assignment is under the `module-1` folder of your repository.
2. Open the project in the `checkpoint` folder.
3. You should see the typical folder structure for a project with a skeleton application program (`main()` or `Main()`) method.
4. Any files you create should be placed in the correct folders within the project.
5. Be sure to add, commit, and push your project when you are done or at the end of the assignment.
6. Your instructor will tell you when to begin and give you a "10-minute warning" before the end of the time-box.
