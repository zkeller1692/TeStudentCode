Bug 1

Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee

How did you fix this bug?
I changed the if loop in the getTimesheetsByEmployeeId to a while loop.

Bug 2

Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee
Expected output:
timesheets.size = 3
Actual output:
timesheets.size = 2
How did you fix this bug?
I corrected the sql string in the getTimeSheetsByEmployeeId method in the DOA. The WHERE statement was originally looking
for the employee Id not the project Id.

Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
updated_timesheet_has_expected_values_when_retrieved
Expected output:
Billable hours = true
Actual output:
Billable hours = false
How did you fix this bug?
I added billable to the updateTimesheet method in the DAO in both the sql string and the JDBC template.

Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getBillableHours_returns_correct_total
Expected output:
getBillableHours = 0
Actual output:
getBillableHours = 2
How did you fix this bug?
I added billable to the getBillableHours method in the DAO in the sql string and set it to true so the method only returns results when true.
